//! # dymod
//!
//! This crate provides a macro, `dymod!`, which allows you to specify a Rust module which will by dynamically loaded and hotswapped in debug mode, but statically linked in release mode.
//!
//! Note that this is _very_ much experimental. The current version of this crate is very opinionated about how you structure your dynamic code. Hopefully this will be relaxed a little in future.
//!
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Your dynamically loaded code should be placed in its own sub-crate under your main crate:
//!
//! ```
//! mycrate/
//!   Cargo.toml
//!   src/
//!     main.rs
//!   subcrate/
//!     Cargo.toml
//!     src/
//!       lib.rs
//! ```
//!
//! Your subcrate must also be compiled as a dylib, so in your `subcrate/Cargo.toml` add:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [lib]
//! crate-type = ["dylib"]
//! ```
//!
//! Now you need to add the code that you want to hotswap. Any functions should be `pub` and `#[no_mangle]`. See the [Limitations]("#limitations") section below for what kind of code you can put here.
//!
//! ```rust
//! // subcrate/src/lib.rs
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub fn count_sheep(sheep: u32) -> &'static str
//! {
//!     match sheep
//!     {
//!         0 => "None",
//!         1 => "One",
//!         2 => "Two",
//!         3 => "Many",
//!         _ => "Lots"
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Finally, use the `dymod!` macro to specify your module, along with the functions that are dynamically available from it.
//!
//! ```rust
//! // mycrate/src/main.rs
//!
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate dymod;
//!
//! dymod!
//! {
//!     #[path = "../subcrate/src/lib.rs"]
//!     pub mod subcrate
//!     {
//!         fn count_sheep(sheep: u32) -> &'static str;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main()
//! {
//!     assert_eq!(subcrate::count_sheep(3), "Many");
//!     loop
//!     {
//!         // You can now edit the count_sheep function and see
//!         // the results change while this code is running.
//!         println!("{}", subcrate::count_sheep(3));
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! This is really, really unsafe! But only in debug mode. In release mode, the module you specify is linked statically as if it was a regular module, and there should be no safety concerns.
//!
//! Here is a partial list of what can go wrong in debug mode:
//!
//! -   If you are holding on to data owned by the dylib when the dylib is hotswapped, you will get undefined behaviour.
//! -   If you take ownership of any data allocated by the dylib, dropping that data will probably cause a segfault.
//! -   If you change the definition of a struct on either side of the boundary, you could get undefined behaviour
//!
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! So as described above, you cannot rely on hotswapping to work if you change struct definitions while your code is running.
//!
//! You also cannot reliably take ownership of heap allocated data from one side of the boundary to the other.
//!
//! Generic functions will not work either.
//!
//! This is again, just a partial list. There really are quite a lot of constraints on what you can do.
//!
//!
//! ## So what is this actually good for then?
//!
//! I suppose we'll see!
//!
//! Here are some examples of code that should work and would be useful to hotswap:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub fn game_update(state: &mut GameState)
//! {
//!     // Modify game state.
//!     // No need to return anything problematic.
//!     unimplemented!()
//! }
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub fn animate_from_to(point_a: [f32; 2], point_b: [f32; 2], time: f32) -> [f32; 2]
//! {
//!     // Returns only stack-allocated values and so is safe.
//!     // Specific kind of animation can be changed on the fly.
//!     unimplemented!()
//! }
//!
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub fn get_configuration() -> Config
//! {
//!     // Again, returns only stack-allocated values.
//!     // Allows changing some configuration while running.
//!     Config
//!     {
//!         ...
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// Takes a module definition and allows it to be hotswapped in debug mode.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignored
/// dymod!
/// {
///     #[path = "../subcrate/src/lib.rs"]
///     pub mod subcrate
///     {
///         fn count_sheep(sheep: u32) -> &'static str;
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This creates a module with a single function, `count_sheep`. In debug mode, this function
/// will call into the dynamically loaded `subcrate` dylib. If that crate is recompiled, this
/// function will use the updated code.
///
/// In release mode, this module becomes just a regular Rust module with the contents of
/// `../subcrate/src/lib.rs`. No dynamic linking is performed at all, and the functions are as
/// safe as if they were included normally in this crate.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics can occur _only_ in debug mode as a result of the various pitfalls of dynamic
/// linking. These can be the result of:
///
/// 1.  Dropping data which was allocated in the other library.
/// 2.  Holding onto references to data that is dropped when the dylib is hotswapped.
/// 3.  Changing the definition of a struct that is passed to or from the other library.
/// 4.  Very many other things.
///
/// These problems should all disappear in release mode, where this code is just statically
/// linked as normal.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// As above, dynamic linking is inherently unsafe. In debug mode, these things can cause a
/// variety of undefined behaviour. For example, see [`sharedlib`](https://docs.rs/sharedlib/7.0.0/sharedlib/#pitfalls), which this crate uses internally.
