All contributions are welcome via [pull-requests on GitHub](https://github.com/Mistodon/dymod/pulls).

Here are some guidelines for contributing:

1.  Keep PRs small and focused.
2.  If you want to make a larger change, [raise an issue](https://github.com/Mistodon/dymod/issues) first to get some feedback.
3.  Make sure all tests pass (run `./all_tests.sh`) and you have added tests for your changes.

Bonus points for:

1.  Running `clippy` and fixing any warnings.
2.  Running `cargo fmt` to keep code-style consistent.

Thank you!
